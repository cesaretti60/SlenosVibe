# SlenosVibe

**SlenosVibe** is a decentralized music licensing infrastructure built on the Avalanche C-Chain. It empowers artists, producers, and rights holders to tokenize tracks as NFTs, automate royalty distribution via smart contracts, and manage licenses transparently—without intermediaries.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🎵 **NFT Music Rights**: Each track is represented as an NFT for immutable ownership and licensing.
- 💸 **Royalty Automation**: Smart contracts distribute revenues instantly and fairly.
- 📄 **Custom Licensing**: Terms, territories, and usage are encoded and enforced on-chain.
- 🛠️ **EVM-Compatible**: Built with Solidity, fully compatible with MetaMask and Web3.
- 🔐 **MiCAR-Compliant**: Developed under the European Regulation 2023/1114 for crypto-assets.

## 💡 Vision

To democratize access to music monetization tools, reduce exploitation in the industry, and provide a secure, transparent environment for creative rights management.
